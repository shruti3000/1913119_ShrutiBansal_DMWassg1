## Simple Implementation of Apriori Algorithm with **Minimum Support of 60%** on a dataset having 10 transactions

Apriori is an Algorithm to finds Frequent itemset with support > minimum support. Support = Occurences.

## Apriori Property
All non-empty subset of frequent itemset must be frequent. The key concept of Apriori algorithm is its anti-monotonicity of support measure. Apriori assumes that

## Limitations of Apriori Algorithm
Apriori Algorithm can be slow. The main limitation is time required to hold a vast number of candidate sets with much frequent itemsets, low minimum support or large itemsets i.e. it is not an efficient approach for large number of datasets.

## Libraries Used-Pandas & Numpy
